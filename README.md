The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for Windows-based systems. Jarvis draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands or using keyboard input. As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in google, bing or yahoo, searching for videos, retrieving images, live weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details, health recommendations based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user statements/commands are analysed with the help of machine learning to give an optimal solution. Keywords:- Personal Assistant, Windows Systems, Automation, Machine Learning
